        </div>
        <pre>
            Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid.

            There are two players, one playing "X" and the other playing "O".

            The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or
             diagonally.

            The first player to get three of their marks in a row wins the game.

            If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three marks in a row, the game is a tie.

            When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

         <pre>
        Try to get three of your X or O marks in a row as quickly as possible.

        Block your opponent from getting three of their marks in a row.

        Pay attention to the center square, as it is the most important square on the board.

        Try to create, where you have two ways to win on your next turn.

        You are X , your friend (or the computer in this case) is O . 

        Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

        The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

        When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
